Q1: What are Orphan and Zombie processes?
Orphan Process:
A process which is yet to complete its execution while the parent of the same has already finished the execution is known as Orphan Process.
After the parent process dies the init process takes care of this process.

Zombie Process:
A process which has finished its execution but has an entry in the process table which is then reported to parent process.
The parent process reads the exit status of child and removes it from process table.
If parent exits before childe process the return code is then collected by init process.


Q2: What are the changes that occur when the child process calls the exec system call to execute a new program?
The exec funcion system call replaces the current process with the new process and executes the specified program from the entry point.
After executing the program the control is not returned to the calling process.
